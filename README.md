# Trivia Night

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, my family and I used to go to a local bar for trivia every Tuesday night.
To keep up the practice, while ensuring safe stay-at-home measures, I created a Web app that was possible to use
over video conference that went by the format we used at the live trivia we attended.

The format is as follows:
-6 rounds plus halftime and final questions
ROUNDS:
-3 questions per round
-categories revealed at start of round
--> first half wagers of 2,4,6
--> second half wagers of 5,7,9
-wagers can only be used once per round
-no penalty for wrong answers
HALFTIME:
-4+ correct answers
-teams may answer no more than 4
-3 points for every correct response (12 pts max)
FINAL:
-put 4 quantitative values in order from smallest to largest
-wager up to 20 points
-wrong answer results in loss of wager

Highest score at the end of the game wins.

All of these elements are captured in this game.

This has allowed us to play with friends and family from across the country twice a week.
